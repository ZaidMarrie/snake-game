### Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, Scrimba has 20 free courses on their interactive platform, and they 
continue launching free courses. But to pay their bills, they have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying 
one of their paid courses. See below are a few:

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript) 

Happy Coding!
